# Example of checking if a person is 18 or older

# Let's define a variable for the person's age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check if the age is 18 or older
if age >= 18:
    print("You are 18 or older. You are eligible.")
else:
    print("You are younger than 18. You are not eligible.")
